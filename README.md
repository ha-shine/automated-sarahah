## Introduction
This is an automated message sender for [Sarahah] social media application, using [Headless-Chrome] and [Selenium]. This will notify the sender via email using [SendGrid] if there is any error, or if the message has been successfully sent. Currently I am using this to fetch quote of the day from [Quotes.Rest].

## Installation
For this you need [Chrome] browser, and Selenium Chrome webdriver which can be found [here][Selenium-Chrome].
After getting them, install the python packages from requirements.txt using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## How to run?
Just cd to the directory and run ```main.py```.
